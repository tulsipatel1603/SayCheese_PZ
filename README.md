# Patient Zero's Say Cheese PZZZZZ

# Task:

Build a small POC of the front-end and an API showing crud capabilities that displays 5 different cheeses with pictures, price per kilo and the cheese colour. This data should reside within the backend (API) of the app.

# Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

2. Install required modules: `npm i`

3. Run the server `cd server` then `npm run dev`

4. Start the client `cd client` then `npm start`

# Improvements if I had more time

1. Firstly, use a database to manage the data better and cleaner - this would allow me to add/delete (Crud capabilities) data entries into the database
2. Docker and Swagger are new to me, I would have to do research and learn about this to implement it effectively
3. Make the code more modularised by making more files and importing them
4. Add unit testing
